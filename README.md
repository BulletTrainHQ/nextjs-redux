## Running locally against your own Bullet Train API instance

We use Bullet Train to manage features we rollout, if you are using your own bullet train environment (i.e. by editing project_x.js-> bulletTrain) then you will need to have a replica of our flags.

A list of the flags and remote config we're currently using in production can be found here https://gist.github.com/kyle-ssg/4c65b4185d0fe3ae35f73244de5e2fef.
